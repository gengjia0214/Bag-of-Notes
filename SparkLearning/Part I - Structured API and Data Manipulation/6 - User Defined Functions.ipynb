    "\n",
    "- Essentially, the pyspark just provide APIs to access the spark functions in JVM. \n",
    "All the computation is in JVM instead of python.\n",
    "- If write UDF in python, then the worker need to:\n",
    "    - serialize the python to JVM\n",
    "    - execute JVM\n",
    "    - serialize result back to python\n",
    "- Hence, UDFs in python cause overhead and can be much slower than UDFs in Scala/Java\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spark 2.3 released the vectorized Pandas UDFs, which is much faster than the vanila python UDFs.\n",
    "- Scala UDFs is still faster than Pandas UDFs... \n",
    "- Another way is to write the UDFs in Scala, register it. And then use pyspark to call the UDFs in sql...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas UDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalar Pandas UDFs are used for vectorizing scalar operations. To define a scalar Pandas UDF, simply use @pandas_udf to annotate a Python function that takes in pandas.Series as arguments and returns another pandas.Series of the same size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are two important requirements when using scalar pandas UDFs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The input and output series must have the same size.\n",
    "- How a column is split into multiple pandas.Series is internal to Spark, and therefore the result of user-defined function must be independent of the splitting.\n",
