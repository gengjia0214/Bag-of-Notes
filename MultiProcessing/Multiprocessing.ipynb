    "Concurrent processes are processes that will return the same results regardless of the order in which they were executed. A “future” is something that will return a result sometime in the future. The concurrent.futures module provides an event handler, which can be fed functions to be scheduled for future execution. This provides us with a simple model for parallel execution on a multi-core machine.\n",

    "- The thread executor uses threads, the process executor uses processes. The difference is that threads run in the same memory space, while processes have separate memory. This makes it a bit harder to share objects between processes with multiprocessing. Since threads use the same memory, precautions have to be taken or two threads will write to the same memory at the same time. This is what the global interpreter lock is for.\n",
